#Help
Any help would be appreciated !

I need better regexp to highlight the synthax.

I focused on wamp log files, but I also would like to handle any kind of log file (npm.debug.log, etc..)


#Ideas/TODO
- highlight **Date** (all formats)
- highlight **Apache synthax** (http response code, ...etc)
- **filter panel**, filtering search box with options (level: warning, notice, ...etc)
