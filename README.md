#Need help
Any help would be really appreciated !

I need regexp to better highlight the synthax.

I focused on wamp log files, but I also would like to handle any kind of log file.


#Ideas/TODO
- highlight **Date** (all formats)
- highlight **Apache synthax** (http response code, ...etc)
- **filter panel**, filtering search box with options (level: warning, notice, ...etc)

#Release history
##1.0.1
- fix typing error
- had synthax highlighting ``char into suqare brace`` (alternative regexp date)
- update screenshot

##1.0.0
- Initial commit
